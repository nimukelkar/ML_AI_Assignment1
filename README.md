# ML_AI_Assignment1
Calculate mean, median, mode, variance for heights and weights of a given data set and display graphically.

From the given height-weight csv file we are finding the:
1.Mean
2.Median
3.Mode
4.variance
5.Standard deviation

for the height and weight of the people using numpys and plotting a histogram of the same using matplotlib.
The output of the above entries were as follows:-

After plotting the height histogram looks like :-
